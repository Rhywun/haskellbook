Coding along with "Haskell Programming From First Principles"

*N.B.*
* The folder 'hello' from Chapter 13 refuses to sync. ???
* Beginning with Chapter 8, I decided it would be easier to integrate the miscellaneous
  exercises that appear throughout each chapter into that chapter's Scratch.hs file and have
  the Exercises.hs file contain only the Chapter Exercises that appear at the end of the
  chapter.

Note to self - I have skipped the following exercises during this run-through. Maybe go back and try them later!
