Coding along with "[Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com)"

*TODO*
* Reformat all files with `brittany` which I started using in mid-2018 as part of
  [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/alanz/vscode-hie-server)
  and [Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/alanz/haskell-ide-engine).

*N.B.*
* Beginning with Chapter 8, I decided it would be easier to integrate the miscellaneous
  exercises that appear throughout each chapter into that chapter's Scratch.hs file and have
  the Exercises.hs file contain only the Chapter Exercises that appear at the end of the
  chapter.
